xUnit.net

This is the framework we are using for writing our unit tests.
It is very light weight, extensible and easy to use.

Fake it Easy

We switched from Moq to FakeItEasy to setup mocks, stubs, fakes, what-have-you.
 Has a shorter learning curve and a more consistent calling convention.

AutoFixture

An open source framework for .NET designed to minimize the 'Arrange' phase of your unit tests.
Its primary goal is to allow developers to focus on what is being tested rather than how to setup
the test scenario, by making it easier to create object graphs containing test data.

This library integrates seamlessly with xUnit.net, and allows unit tests to be parameterized,
allowing the test inputs to be passed into the unit test method directly.  Takes a lot of the
suck out of the test setups.

There isn’t any formal documentation, but rather of series of blog posts by the author.
All are worth reading, and it will probably take reading several times before you truly get it.
That was my experience, anyway :)

Books

I’ve found the following books helpful , and they are available on Safari Books Online, which Nuance provides as a perk.   I think you need to enroll as part of Nuance University, but I don’t remember, and things could have changed.  I’m sure thevoice.nuance.com (https://nuance.jiveon.com/docs/DOC-44051) would be as helpful as always ;)  You should be able to use your Nuance domain creds to access Safari.  Anyway, they get into how to design/structure testable code, as well as how to test.
