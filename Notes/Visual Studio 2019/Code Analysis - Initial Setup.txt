1. You will need to add the "StyleCop.Analyzers" NuGet package to each of
   the .NET Core projects that you wish to use Code Analysis on.

2. You have to enable "Full Solution Analysis" in Visual Studio 2017 by going
   to the "Tools" menu and selecting the "Options..." item.

   Go to the "Text Editor" section (in the left most pane) and open "C#" and then click
   on the "Advanced" item.

   Make sure that "Background analysis scope:" is set to "Entire solution".

3. You will want to make sure that you are not inserting tabs when indenting code.

   Go to the "Tools" menu and select the "Options..." item.

   Go to the "Text Editor" section (in the leftmost pane) and open "All Languages" and then "Tabs".

   Make sure that "Insert spaces" item is checked.

4. You will want to change each projects properties to treat all warnings as errors.

   In Visual Studio, right click on the project and select "Properties".

   Go to the "Build" tab and change the "Configuration:" drop down to be "All Configurations".

   Select the "All" option under "Treat warnings as errors".

5. Restart Visual Studio 2019.
