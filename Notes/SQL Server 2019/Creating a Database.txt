1. Right click on "Databases" and select "New Database".

2. In the "General" tab specify the database name.

3. In the "Options" tab set the "Recovery Model" to "Simple" if you are doing this on a development machine.

4. Select "OK".

5. If you might need to use the LIKE operator or do other full text searches you will need to verify that
   full text search is enabled.

   To do this open a "New Query" window and run the following SQL:

   SELECT FULLTEXTSERVICEPROPERTY('IsFullTextInstalled')

   If the query returns 1 then Full-Text Search is enabled. If it returns 0 then Full-Text Search is not
   enabled and you will need to run SQL Server Installation Center to add the Full-Text Search feature.
